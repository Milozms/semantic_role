prepro.py: data preprocess
perceptron.py: model

running:
python3 prepro.py
python3 perceptron.py

Note:
1.Running the perceptron.py code requires all the preprocessed data, which is too large to upload;
2.Running the preprocess.py code requires several hours (calling Stanford Parser).
3.If you need to run the code, please contact me by zhangmaosen@pku.edu.cn (email) or 18810512898(message or wechat).

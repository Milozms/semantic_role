\begin{abstract}
  We develop a semantic role labeling system with structured perceptron. \cite{collins2002discriminative}
  We use Viterbi algorithm in decoding for performance. The core part of 
  our program is written by myself and only some trivial functions are 
  from externel libraries. We achieve 70.83 F1 score on development set.
\end{abstract}

\section{Data Preprocess}
First of all, bracketed representation of roles is converted into IOB2 representation.
For example, the beginning word of role A0 is tagged "A0-B"; 
the following wordw of role A0 are tagged "A0-I"; words not in a role are tagged "O".

Moreover, Although the POS tags are provided in the dataset, we still need other 
information. We use Stanford Parser and Stanford CoreNLP packet to 
generate Named Entity Recognition (NER) labels and parsing trees for 
the sentences in the dataset.

\section{Structured Perceptron}
We use structured perceptron as the sequence labeling model for the task.\cite{collins2002discriminative}
$$
score_y = \sum_i \lambda_{f_i(x,y)} f_i(x, y)
$$

\subsection{Features}
The features we use in the perceptron are following. In order to improve efficiency,
we divide those features into four groups: word features, verb features, 
relative features, tag features.

Word features are features concerning the current word:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Word unigram, bigram, trigram: $w_i$, $w_{i-1}w_i$, $w_i w_{i+1}$, 
  $w_{i-1}w_i w_{i+1}$, $w_{i-2}w_{i-1}w_i$, $w_i w_{i+1}w_{i+2}$;
  \item POS tag unigram, bigram, trigram;
  \item NER tag unigram, bigram, trigram;
\end{itemize}
Verb features are features concerning the given verb:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Verb context: word and POS tag unigram, bigram, trigram around the verb;
  \item Sentence length;
\end{itemize}
Relative features are features concerning both the current word and the given verb:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The postion of current word relative to the verb (before, is, after);\cite{hacioglu2004semantic}
  \item The distance between current word and verb (minus means before);
  \item The path between the current word and the verb in the parsing tree\cite{xue2004calibrating};
\end{itemize}
Tag features (actually the transition score between the previous tag and the current tag):
\begin{itemize}
  \item The semantic role label of previous word.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Collecting Features for instances}
In order to improve efficiency, we collect different features in different stages.
We initialize the dataset with their word features and verb features before training
and store them, so that we can save the time for collecting them during training time. 
While the relative features and tag features are collected during training and decoding time.
Note that the tag features are collected dynamically depending the viterbi process during decoding.
We design different functions for getting those features.

Because the word, verb and relative features are static during viterbi process, which are 
independent of previous decode label, we call them "static features" and we design a function 
for collecting them together.

\subsubsection{Feature Representation}
Since the feature vectors are sparse, we use hash table (dict in Python) to store weights for given 
feature template and label. For example, weights['W=apple']['A0-B'] indicates the weight for feature 
"current word is apple and tag is A0-B". We store features in a list and retrieve weights for them and 
compute the score.

\subsection{Viterbi Decode}
Given a sentence with its features and weights, we use viterbi algorithm to decode the 
tag sequence.
\begin{equation}
\pi(j,u,v)=\\
max_{<t_1, ..., t_{j-2}>}score(t_1, ..., t_{j-2}, u, v)
\end{equation}
We use dynamic programming to compute the lattice $\pi$:
\begin{equation}
\pi(j,u,v)=max_t(\pi(j-1,t,u)+score(j,t,u,v))
\end{equation}

\subsection{Training}
For each instance of training dataset, we first use viterbi algorithm to decode the tag sequence 
with current weights. Then we compare the decoded sequence with the golden sequence and update 
the weights according to the difference between the two sequences. More specificly, let the 
golden tag sequence be $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$ and the decoded predicted tag sequence be 
$z_1, z_2, ..., z_n$. If $y_k \neq z_k$, we will increase the weights for the features of $g_k$ 
and the transition score of $y_{k-1}$ and $y_k$, and decrease the weights for the features of 
$p_k$ and the transition score of $z_{k-1}$ and $z_k$. (This is extreamly important according to
experiment!)

Let $Z$ be decoded sequence:
$$Z=argmax_{t[1:n]\in GEN(w[1:n])} \lambda\cdot f(w[1:n],t[1:n]) $$ 
If $Z_k \neq Y_k$, update:
$$\lambda^* = \lambda + f(X_k, Y_k) - f(X_k, Z_k)$$

\subsection{Averaged Perceptron}
According to Collins \cite{collins2002discriminative}, we compute the 
averaged model parameters of models after training several iterations,
and use these parameters to inference the input data. It significantly 
improved the performance.

\section{Experiment}

On development dataset, We got results as Tabel 1 shows.
